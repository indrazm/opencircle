## Architecture

OpenCircle is built as a modern monorepo with three main applications:

- **Platform App**: User-facing React application for learning and community
- **Admin App**: React-based dashboard for content and user management
- **API**: FastAPI backend with modular architecture

For detailed architecture and development patterns, see the [documentation](docs/):
- [API Documentation](docs/api.md) - Backend architecture, modules, and patterns
- [Admin App Documentation](docs/admin.md) - Admin interface structure and features
- [Platform App Documentation](docs/platform.md) - User app structure and features

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone and configure**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devscalelabs/opencircle.git
   cd opencircle
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure environment** (edit `.env`):
   - Cloudflare R2 credentials for media storage
   - Database and Redis URLs (defaults work for Docker)

3. **Start the platform**:
   ```bash
   make docker-migrate  # Run database migrations
   make docker-up       # Start all services
   ```

4. **Access the applications**:
   - **Platform**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:4000
   - **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Local Development

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 20+, Python 3.12+, pnpm, PostgreSQL, Redis

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
cd apps/api && uv sync && cd ../..

# Start services
docker compose up -d postgres redis  # Or use local instances
cd apps/api && uv run alembic upgrade head && cd ../..

# Run applications
make dev  # Starts all apps with Moon
```

See the [development documentation](docs/) for detailed setup instructions.
