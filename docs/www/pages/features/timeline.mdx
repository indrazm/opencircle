The Timeline feature provides activity feeds and updates in OpenCircle, serving as the central hub for viewing all community interactions.

## Overview

Timeline displays:
- Recent activities
- Community posts
- User interactions
- Channel activity feeds

## Relationship with Other Features

**Timeline and Posts**: Timeline aggregates all posts created within channels and displays them in a chronological feed. When users create posts in different channels, those posts appear in the timeline, allowing users to see all community discussions in one place regardless of which channel they were posted in.

**Timeline and Channels**: Channels organize posts by topic or community, while the timeline provides a unified view across all channels. Users can use the timeline to stay informed about activity from all channels they have access to, then navigate to specific channels for focused discussions.

**Timeline and Admin Channels**: Administrators can monitor channel activity through the timeline to understand community engagement patterns and ensure healthy discussions across all channels.
