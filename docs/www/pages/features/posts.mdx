## Usage

Users can create posts within channels to start discussions, share insights, ask questions, and engage with the learning community. When creating a post, users can:

- Select or change the target channel for their post
- Mention other users using @username to draw their attention
- Upload files, images, or documents to support their content
- Use rich text formatting to create comprehensive posts
- Participate in threaded conversations through comments

Posts serve as the primary medium for community interaction, knowledge sharing, and collaborative learning within the structured channel environment.

## Integration with Timeline

Posts created within channels are automatically aggregated and displayed in the Timeline feature, providing users with a unified view of all community discussions across channels. This allows users to discover and engage with posts from any channel without needing to navigate to each channel individually.
