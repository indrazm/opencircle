title: Platform Setup
---

Once you've deployed OpenCircle using Docker, follow these steps to set up your platform and get started.

## Access the Admin Panel

1. Navigate to your admin dashboard: **http://localhost:4000** (or your configured `ADMIN_URL`)
2. Log in with your admin credentials

## Create Your First Channel

Channels are the foundation of community interaction in OpenCircle. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Community Management** → **Channels**
2. Click **Create Channel**
3. Fill in the channel details:
   - **Name**: Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g., "General", "Announcements")
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of the channel's purpose
   - **Visibility**: Choose between public or private
4. Click **Save** to create the channel

## Configure Additional Channels (Optional)

Create additional channels for different purposes:

- **General**: For general discussions
- **Announcements**: For important updates
- **Support**: For user support queries
- **Random**: For off-topic conversations

## Access the Platform

1. Navigate to your platform: **http://localhost:3000** (or your configured `PLATFORM_URL`)
2. Users can now sign up or log in
3. They'll see all public channels available to them

## Next Steps

- **Invite Users**: Use invite codes to bring users into your community (found in Admin → Community Management → Invite Codes)
- **Create Content**: Add courses, lessons, and articles through the Admin Dashboard
- **Customize Settings**: Configure app settings, authentication methods, and more in Admin → Core Admin → App Settings

## Troubleshooting

**Can't access admin panel?**
- Verify all services are running: `docker compose ps`
- Check if port 4000 is accessible: `curl http://localhost:4000`

**Channels not appearing in platform?**
- Ensure channels are set to public visibility
- Refresh the platform page and clear browser cache
- Check API connectivity: verify `VITE_API_URL` in your `.env`

**Users can't log in?**
- Verify database is running and accessible
- Check authentication settings in Admin → Core Admin → Auth
- Review API logs: `docker compose logs api`
